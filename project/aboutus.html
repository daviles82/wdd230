    <h3>OUR HISTORY</h3>
      <p>Bountiful Foods has been a family owned and operated business for over a hundred years in Carlsbad, 
        California. It all started in the early 1920s, a few years after Prohibition went into effect, banning 
        the production, importation, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages in the United States. 
        Bountiful Foods, known at the time as Bountiful Moon, was in the business of creating moonshine for 
        mainstream consumption. After the ban, the company took on a different approach after their business 
        took a financial hit. Soon after, David Aviles III noticed an improvement in his health and began 
        promoting healthy fruits and vegetables to the masses. He was inspired by the temperance movement. Now, 
        over a hundred years later, Bountiful Foods uses local and international suppliers to fill in seasonal 
        changes in agriculture supplies to serve the masses. Bountiful Foods has never deviated from its roots 
        of finding natural organic sources of nutrition even after Prohibition was repealed in 1933 and all the 
        pesticide and artificially created agriculture has become the norm. </p>

      <p>Carlsbad is a seaside city on the Pacific Ocean in the northern part of San Diego County, California. 
        It is about halfway between Los Angeles and San Diego, two major urban centers. Carlsbad attracts many 
        visitors and businesses with its golf courses and resorts. It also features the Flower Fields at Carlsbad 
        Ranch, a spectacular display of colorful flowers that blossom every spring. Carlsbad enjoys a mild and 
        sunny climate, with an average yearly temperature of 64 °F (18 °C) and an average yearly rainfall of 11 
        inches (280 mm). Carlsbad’s land is fertile and well-watered, thanks to the several lagoons and creeks 
        that flow through it. These natural resources also support a variety of wildlife, such as birds, fish, 
        and plants. Bountiful Foods benefits from this natural abundance by growing and obtaining its organic 
        fruits and vegetables from local sources. Bountiful Foods’ products are fresh, tasty, and healthy, 
        mirroring the beauty and quality of life in Carlsbad.</p>
