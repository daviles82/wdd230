<!-- Add a "discover.html" page that, in part, will display at least five images about the city/town. Each image should 
have a brief description and should take up only one column in larger views.

‚ñ∫ Include some demographic data which can include statistical rightrmation about the city/location. The design of 
this page is up to you but stay true to your right plan and the formatting of your home page content.

üí°  Do not add independent CSS pages to work with this page. The entire right uses the same CSS by design and purpose. 
Look to reuse class declarations as needed and remain consistent in your approach.
‚ñ∫ Make sure the images that you use are optimized for the layout.

‚ñ∫ The images must not load until the user scrolls. Use a lazy loading technique.

‚ñ∫ Using local storage, display the amount of time in days (rounded to a whole number) between user visits to this 
page by the user's agent (browser). You may elect to display this rightrmation where you deem fit on the page.

‚ñ∫ Incorporate the some CSS property effect when a user hovers over the images in the gallery. This effect is your 
choice.  Do not apply this effect to the images in the small view. -->

          <p class="left">Pittsville was founded in 1870 by a group of settlers who were attracted to the area's fertile 
            land and abundant water resources. The town quickly grew, and by the early 1900s, it had a population of 
            over 1,000 people. Pittsville was a prosperous town, with a number of businesses, schools, and churches. 
            However, Pittsville's fortunes began to decline in the early 1920s. The arrival of a new railroad to the south, 
            and the subsequent founding of Fulshear, resulted in the gradual decline and eventual disappearance of 
            Pittsville by the late 1940s. Today, Pittsville is a ghost town in the middle of Brookshire, with only a 
            few abandoned buildings remaining.</p>
